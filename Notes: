Single ConfigMap per service:
    can hold Extra Environnement Variables + Files
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/

NP:
There are many reasons why you may chose to employ Kubernetes network policies:

Ensure containers assigned to different environments (e.g. dev/staging/prod) cannot interfere with one another
Isolate multi-tenant deployments
Regulatory compliance
Segregate teams
Enforce best practices



Secrets:
    As files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers.
    As container environment variable.

    As Dockerconfig for registry (Handled to Environnement Resource.)

    Opaque	arbitrary user-defined data  (Scope: Container)
